  Since beginning this jorney in pursuing programming as a career I have not regretted my choice at all. I have been able to do a variety of projects some successful while others not so much. Most of these projects I did while I was in university at Strathmore University; they were mostly based on HTML and javascipt since they were online applications.I am a bit shy and reserved but once people get to know me  and interact I'm quite a fun guy.
